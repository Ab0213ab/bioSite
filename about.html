            Jude seems to have always had a creative mind; she went to school for art and 
            design and was once the Director of the Design Department for the May Company, 
            a massive upscale department store chain operator. Jude was an interior 
            designer for a Midwestern design firm and a co-owner of a design firm and 
            furniture store in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Jude also started and operated 
            a food business in Washington State and has sold residential real estate in 
            both Florida and in Washington. These career accomplishments are impressive, 
            but when asked about her proudest achievements and goals, Jude mentioned her 
            family multiple times. Being there for her loved ones has always been a major 
            goal for Jude and the love she has for everyone in her family is something 
            she is rightfully proud of.

            Jude Schaefer’s life story is one of creativity, selflessness, vigor, 
            and inspiration. Jude had a quiet and morally conscious small-town 
            upbringing in <a href="http://www.emporia-kansas.gov" target="_blank">Emporia, Kansas</a>, where when 
            she was born the census bureau estimated the town only had a population 
            of just over 13,000 people. Her healthy childhood allowed her to develop 
            a strong moral compass that eventually led to her political involvement 
            and interest in community service and social justice issues. Jude is 
            justifiably proud of some of the work she has done over the years; 
            she volunteered for former President Barack Obama's campaign, as well 
            as marched in the first Woman's March in downtown Seattle. Jude has 
            given her time to the Head Start Program (link to external site here) 
            which is an organization run by the Department of Health and Human 
            Services that aims to assist families in need by providing early 
            childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement 
            services. Jude’s favorite quote by Mahatma Gandhi perfectly sums up 
            her outlook on life: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.”

            As someone who has always been full of energy, it comes as no surprise that 
            Jude Schaefer she has kept that vivacity into her golden years as she still 
            sells real estate, hikes, travels, exercises, sails, and snorkels. Many 
            positive things have occurred in Jude’s life, but her story also includes 
            immense heartbreak; Jude lost her first husband to drugs, her son to suicide, 
            two parents and two brothers have passed, and recently Jude lost her daughter 
            to brain cancer. However, through these “hailstorms” as she calls them, Jude 
            has never lost her passion for others or her enthusiasm for life. Jude’s 
            ability to continue to bring about positivity even in the worst of times 
            makes her a genuine inspiration.
